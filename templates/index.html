            <p class="text-center">Welcome to DerHuaso, a restaurant that brings the flavors of Chilean dishes to Germany. Our story began in 1995
            when our founder, Ignacio, moved to Germany from Chile. He missed the taste of home and wanted to share it with
            others. So, she started cooking traditional Chilean dishes in her kitchen and invited her friends over to try them.
            They loved the food so much that they encouraged her to open a restaurant.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-center">Weâ€™re proud to say that we use only the freshest ingredients in our dishes and prepare everything from scratch. We also
            have an extensive selection of Latin American wines and cocktails to complement your meal.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-center">Thank you for choosing DerHuaso Restaurant We hope you enjoy your dining experience with us!</p>
